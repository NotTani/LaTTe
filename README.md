LaTTe is an open source Python-Markdown extension meant to make math formatting easy.
Its math syntax is quite similar to AsciiMath, but with more granular formatting controls
and custom extensions.

## State of the project
* **Math formatting language** -- base implemented (lexer, parser, MathML generator), no public facing APIs at the 
  moment
* **Web interface** -- basic version working well, could do with better error reporting
* **Proof/formal logic block** -- started
* **Unified Block API** -- started
* **Publishing to PyPi/Build Workflow** -- started
* **Document Headers** -- not started
